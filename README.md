-- Year progress webpage/notion widget --

This is a webpage that serves primary as a year progress widget for Notion, currently only in dark mode. (I'll probably add light mode soonish, maybe a few weeks?) Of course you could use it for whatever you want to, but the background colour is made purposely the same as notions dark mode colour so it looks as seamless as possible. 

I'm looking at a way that anyone can set the page to whatever background colour they like but this is a far future project, unless anyone else decides to add to this project, which by the way is greatly appreciated, and of course you will be credited in every release your code is used (most likely indefinitely, so long as the code is in some way used)

This is currently not live as of 08/02/2024, I was previously using GitHub pages but as they only allow one page, I will be hosting the page on an external hosting provider soon, once this happens this page will change and have a link to the page. 
*The code is still open source and free for anyone to use, so if you want to host it yourself go ahead!*

**This project will forever stay free for anyone to use and open source**

For hosting the webpage that will be paid for by me personally, or any donations I may receive. 

Any pull requests are encouraged, if you think you could improve something about it big or small, then go ahead and do so!
